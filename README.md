### 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm **Noor Zia**, a **Business Intelligence Analyst** currently working full-time while pursuing my **Master’s in Artificial Intelligence**.  
My professional journey bridges the world of **data analytics and AI**, allowing me to connect business strategy with machine learning innovation.

Through this portfolio, I’m documenting how my skills evolve from building data-driven dashboards and insights to designing AI-based systems that make decision-making smarter and more human-centered.  

Balancing full-time work and advanced studies has strengthened my adaptability — a trait I consider essential in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.  
Each artifact I create reflects not just technical ability, but also a commitment to lifelong learning and the belief that technology should enhance creativity, not replace it.

## 🎯 **Title**
**AI & ML Timelines: My Journey of Learning and Application**

---

## 📍 **Objective**
The purpose of this artifact is to present a structured timeline that demonstrates my progress and adaptability in AI and ML concepts.  
This project showcases how my technical understanding evolved through coursework, labs, and experimentation — while developing the ability to apply data-driven thinking to real-world challenges.

---

## 🔄 **Process**
I developed this portfolio using **GitHub** to serve as both a learning log and a professional artifact.  
Each milestone reflects:
- ✅ Key skills learned (data preprocessing, supervised learning, model tuning)  
- 💻 Hands-on projects (chatbots, ML classifiers, optimization models)  
- 🌱 Reflections on challenges and lessons learned  

This timeline is continuously updated as I expand my skills and integrate new technologies into my projects.

## 💡 **Value Proposition**
This artifact represents both technical skill and adaptability — showing how I use AI tools responsibly and creatively.  
It demonstrates my ability to **translate theory into practice**, communicate data insights, and maintain ethical AI awareness.

> “AI isn’t here to replace us — it’s here to remind us how powerful human creativity can be when we work with technology instead of fearing it.”

---

## 🪞 **Reflection**
Creating this timeline helped me see how my understanding of AI has matured over time — from early curiosity to structured analysis and model development.  
It highlights my ability to learn independently, document processes clearly, and adapt to emerging technologies.  
I plan to continue growing this portfolio by adding new experiments, mini-projects, and collaborations in the future.
